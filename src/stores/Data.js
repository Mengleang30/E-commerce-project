    description: `The Secret by Rhonda Byrne is a self-help book that explores the 
        concept of the law of attraction, which suggests that our 
        thoughts and beliefs can shape our reality. Byrne emphasizes 
        that positive thinking, visualization, and gratitude are key to attracting success, health, happiness, and other desires into one’s life. 
        The book draws from various spiritual, scientific, and philosophical sources and presents a practical approach to harnessing these principles to 
        achieve personal goals and transform one’s mindset. It encourages readers to focus on what they want, rather than what they don’t want, as a way to manifest positive outcomes.

        virtues, such as courage, generosity and justice, and intellectual virtues, such as knowledge, wisdom and insight.
